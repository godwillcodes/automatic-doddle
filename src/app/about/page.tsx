            At the ripe age of 26, I, Godwill, proudly wear the mantle of a seasoned Lead Web Developer, tracing my journey back to the dawn of the digital age. Picture this: a sprightly 6-year-old version of myself, armed with nothing but curiosity and a newfound Macintosh LC 550, diving headfirst into the enigmatic world of coding. Ah, the memories!

              The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was automotive engineering, I decided to upgrade my dad's trusty old lawnmower. Armed with nothing but a toolbox and boundless enthusiasm, I set out to give it a turbo boost. Let's just say, the end result wasn't quite what I expected. Instead of mowing the lawn, it performed a thrilling sprint down the driveway, leaving a trail of freshly cut grass in its wake. Needless to say, my dad wasn't too thrilled with the "improvement," but hey, it was worth a shot!

            From intern to innovator, my journey through the tech landscape has been nothing short of an adventure. It all began at Procter & Gamble, where I cut my teeth as an IT intern from 2018 to 2019, diving headfirst into the world of tech with ambition and a knack for problem-solving. Next, at Legibra Solutions from 2019 to 2021, I embraced the challenges of the digital frontier as a Web Developer, transforming pixels into possibilities one line of code at a time. And now, at Belva Digital, I've risen to the ranks of Software Engineer, where amidst the whirlwind of innovation and creativity, I continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm. My journey is a testament to the power of perseverance and a sprinkle of wit along the way.
